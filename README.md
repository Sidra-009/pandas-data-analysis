## 📖 About This Repository

This repository documents my **hands-on practice with the Pandas library**.
Its primary purpose is to **strengthen my understanding of data manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization** in Python.

The repo includes multiple datasets and demonstrates a variety of Pandas operations such as:

* 📂 Reading datasets (CSV files)
* 🔎 Exploring data (`head()`, `tail()`, `info()`, `describe()`)
* 🎯 Indexing & slicing with `.iloc[]` & `.loc[]`
* 📊 Data aggregation with `groupby()`
* 🔗 Merging & joining datasets
* 🔄 Handling missing values (`dropna()`, `fillna()`)
* 📑 Pivot tables for summarization
* 📈 Visualizations (Pandas built-in plotting + Matplotlib)
* 🧹 Removing duplicates
* 📐 Sorting values (`sort_values()`)
* 📝 Applying custom functions for transformations
